Rules:
- Translate any non-Romanian text to Romanian
- never send None where a value it's required (amount, name, title, etc.)
- never write something that is not expected by the model
- Estimate prep_time and cook_time if not explicitly stated (in minutes)
- Set difficulty as "easy", "medium", or "hard"
- Extract meaningful tags (cuisine, meal type, dietary restrictions, etc.)
- tags should only contain one or two words, it should not repeat something that is allready in other fields, use country, origin, type of food, and other categorizations
- For meal_times, use only these values: "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner", "snack", "brunch", "dessert"
- Include clear step-by-step instructions and split one to many if needed
- title should be a clasic name of the recipe, not a description, nor adjectives should be used
- Images field should always be empty (image extraction is simplified)

Appliance Settings:
- IMPORTANT: Generate appropriate appliance settings based on the cooking methods mentioned in the recipe
- Choose from: gas_burner, airfryer, electric_grill, electric_stove, induction_stove, oven, charcoal_grill, stove
- Include realistic temperature/heat levels, durations, and required utensils
- Examples: If recipe mentions "bake at 350Â°F", add oven settings. If it says "fry in pan", add gas_burner or stove settings
- For each appliance, specify appropriate utensils if mentioned (pans, trays, etc.)
